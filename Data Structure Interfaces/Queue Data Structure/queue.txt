Can't talk about a stack without talking about a queue. 
Queues adhere to the "First-In First-Out" mantra. 
As the name may invoke the imagery for you, it's similar to people queueing in line (hopefully.) 
All stacks need to have the methods enqueue (add/push) and dequeue (remove/pop). 
Like stacks, they'll have peek to see what the next element is to dequeue.

Queues are useful for lots of programming problems. 
How about print jobs? Usually you want things to print in the order sent to the printer; 
otherwise Janice from Accounting is going to be printing all of her documents before you can print anything.

There are also priority queues as well. 
In a priority queue you also assign a priority to the elements that are enqueued. 
Items that have higher priorities get dequeued first. 
This is useful for networking; some packets are more important than others. 
If you're streaming video, that gets a high priority because getting a packet later means likely skipping some frames, whereas syncing to Dropbox can wait for a lull in network traffic to continue syncing.
