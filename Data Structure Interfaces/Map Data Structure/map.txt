/*
Maps, or dictionaries as they are sometimes referred to, are key-value sets. 
Maps are also very similar to an associative array. Since the keys in a map are a set, there cannot be any duplicates. 
When a value of a key is updated, the previous value is lost.

/*
Maps are quite similar to simple JavaScript objects. 
Maps are a set/collection of keys that have values associated with those keys. 
Unlike objects, they don't have prototypes, inheritance, methods, or anything of that sort. 
Maps are also similar to associative arrays in other languages. 
Again, since the keys are a set, there cannot be duplication of keys (makes sense, right?) You can have duplication of values though. 
Key 'thing' can have value 'map' while key 'other thing' can have a value of 'map' as well.
